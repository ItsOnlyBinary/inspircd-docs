### InspIRCd 4.0.0

**This version of InspIRCd has not yet been released.**

* A compiler with C++14 is now required to build InspIRCd. In practise this means you will need to use at least Clang 3.8, GCC 5, or MSVC 14.

* Various **breaking changes** have been made. See [the breaking changes page](/4/breaking-changes) for details.
