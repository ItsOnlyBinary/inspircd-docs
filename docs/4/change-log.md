### InspIRCd 4.0.0a1

**This pre-release version of InspIRCd was released on 2021-06-01.**

- A compiler with C++17 support is now required to build InspIRCd. In practise this means you will need to use at least Clang 5, GCC 7, or MSVC 19.15.

- Various **breaking changes** have been made. See [the breaking changes page](/4/breaking-changes) for details.
